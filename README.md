# Keypatch_9.0 IDA 9.0 keypatch插件
**Update 2025/2/4:** Fixed Search module. 修复了search问题

# Introduction
Keypatch plugin for ida9.0 from [@y0ush4](https://github.com/y0ush4)'s [Issue(original file here)](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keypatch/issues/94)

For Windows Users like me, if keystone-engine is installed properly in your python env, just put this file in the folder of ida9.0 and it will work.

This file just add if branch to adapt the new api of ida9.0, the src code has nothing diffrent from old keypatch.py.

Windows下用该文件替换原本的keypatch.py即可，文件只是对于新版的api添加了if逻辑的修改，源代码无任何变化。
